## 2. Project Overview
InstaLite is an Instagram-like social media application developed as part of the NETS 
2120 final project. At a high level, it provides users with a platform to share image and 
text-based posts, connect with friends, chat, and discover content through a ranking 
and recommendation system based on adsorption. Services include Node.js, 
JavaScript, RDS, DynamoDB, S3, EC2, EBS, EMR, Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, React, 
Python, ChromaDB, and more, versioned using Git. Natural Language Processing 
and embeddings provide a level of customization, and real-time updates, error 
handling, push notifications, and UI / UX design enables a level of sophistication. 
Security measures and auto-scaling ensures for a (almost) production-ready system.
